  abstract = {Background Attention is turning toward increasing the quality of websites and quality evaluation to attract new users and retain existing users. Objective This scoping study aimed to review and define existing worldwide methodologies and techniques to evaluate websites and provide a framework of appropriate website attributes that could be applied to any future website evaluations. Methods We systematically searched electronic databases and gray literature for studies of website evaluation. The results were exported to EndNote software, duplicates were removed, and eligible studies were identified. The results have been presented in narrative form. Results A total of 69 studies met the inclusion criteria. The extracted data included type of website, aim or purpose of the study, study populations (users and experts), sample size, setting (controlled environment and remotely assessed), website attributes evaluated, process of methodology, and process of analysis. Methods of evaluation varied and included questionnaires, observed website browsing, interviews or focus groups, and Web usage analysis. Evaluations using both users and experts and controlled and remote settings are represented. Website attributes that were examined included usability or ease of use, content, design criteria, functionality, appearance, interactivity, satisfaction, and loyalty. Website evaluation methods should be tailored to the needs of specific websites and individual aims of evaluations. GoodWeb, a website evaluation guide, has been presented with a case scenario. Conclusions This scoping study supports the open debate of defining the quality of websites, and there are numerous approaches and models to evaluate it. However, as this study provides a framework of the existing literature of website evaluation, it presents a guide of options for evaluating websites, including which attributes to analyze and options for appropriate methods.},

  abstract = {The internet has been used by individuals, organizations, and governments for business, sports, health, banking, advertisement, education, and other services. Many websites have been developed and designed in the last several decades. However, most have not been developed and designed according to a shared set of design standards. Consequently, there is a need for an approach to evaluate the effectiveness of a website. A literature review was conducted to develop such an approach. Four experts were then consulted to inspect and evaluate the approach, and a questionnaire was completed by three categories: Internet users, website developers, and others to determine its final version. This research resulted in the development of an approach to evaluate website effectiveness, composed of three major criteria: design, content, and functionality, and 17 sub-criteria. The significance of this new approach is that it allows stakeholders to evaluate their websites and determine how to improve them in order to achieve their vision and mission.},

However, little research has been conducted to define the specific elements used in effective website and mobile application design. We attempt to review and consolidate research on effective design and to define a short list of elements frequently used in research. The design elements mentioned most frequently in the reviewed literature were navigation, graphical representation, organization, content utility, purpose, simplicity, and readability. We discuss how previous studies define and evaluate these seven elements. This review and the resulting short list of design elements may be used to help designers and researchers to operationalize best practices for facilitating and predicting user engagement},

  abstract = {In non-game web applications, one of the problems in User Interface (UI) design is that not all users will perceive the UI as easy to use. If the users are unable to perceive the UI as easy to use, problems in user experience may arise, this is especially so for users using web applications for cloud-based chat and collaboration web services. In order to tackle this problem, this study will identify if the freedom of the user to customize his/her own UI is proportional to the user's perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the UI. A random sample of 50 participants aged 15 to 35 years were invited to use Dropbox™, Google Drive™ and Microsoft's OneDrive™, before being interviewed about their individual user experiences for each menu interface type. It was found that the ability of the user to customise own UI is linked to the user's sense of control over the UI. Since the sense of control over the UI is illustrated to directly impact perceived user efficiency levels, it is highly likely that the customisability is proportional to user's PEOU of the UI. Thus by developing a software that can allow both developers and users to collaborate and cooperate in the creation of user preferred UI design would be able to enhance user satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this empirical study was to address two important concerns of Web usability: how user-intuitive interface signs affect Web usability and how applying semiotics (i.e. the doctrine of signs) in user interface (UI) design and evaluation helps to improve usability. Design/methodology/approach – An empirical research approach is followed here to conduct three user tests. These tests were conducted on a Web application with 17 test participants. Data were gathered through laboratory-based think-aloud usability test, questionnaires and interviews. Following an empirical research approach, statistics and user behavior analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings – This study explores two important concerns of UI design and evaluation. First, users’ interpretation accuracy of interface signs impact on Web usability. The study found that users’ interpretation of signs might be accurate, moderate, conflicting, erroneous or incapable; user-intuitive interface signs led participants to interpret signs’ meaning accurately; and users’ inaccurate interpretation of one or a few task-related interface sign(s) led users to usability problems, resulting in participants performing tasks with lower task-completion performance. Second, considering semiotics perception in UI design and evaluation is important to improve Web usability. This study showed that interface signs, when re-designed considering the semiotics guidelines, have increased the end-users’ interpretation accuracy and the interface signs’ intuitiveness. This study also provides a small set of semiotics guidelines for sign design and evaluation. Originality/value – This study empirically demonstrated that signs’ intuitiveness impact on Web usability and that considering the semiotics perception in sign design and evaluation is important to improve Web usability. These outcomes are valuable in a number of ways to HCI researchers and practitioners: the results provide awareness of the importance of user-intuitive interface signs in UI design; practitioners can easily adopt the concept of interpretation accuracy classification to conduct a sign test to obtain an “overall impression of interface signs’ intuitiveness”; practitioners can easily adopt the methodological approach followed in this study to conduct usability test without additional resources; and the results raised important fundamental questions for future research such as “what does a practitioner need to be aware of when designing or evaluating interface signs?”},

This paper explores the design issues that are specifically relevant for multilingual users. It reports on the continued studies of Information System (IS) issues and users’ behaviour across cross-cultural and transnational boundaries. Taking the BBC website as a model that is internationally recognized, usability tests were conducted to compare different versions of the website. The dependant variables derived from the questionnaire were analysed (via descriptive statistics) to elucidate the multilingual UI design issues. Using principal component analysis, five decorrelated variables were identified, which were then used for hypotheses tests. A modified version of Herzberg’s Hygiene-motivational Theory about the Workplace was applied to assess the components used in the website. Overall, it was concluded that the English versions of the website gave superior usability results and this implies the need for deeper study of the problems in usability of the translated versions.},

  abstract = {Aesthetic principle not only concerns the perception of visual beauty, but most crucially, the cognitive-affective responses derived from experiencing such stimuli. Despite this knowledge, user experience (UX) designers often prioritise beauty over intended end-user affect. This reversed order of prioritisation contradicts the sequential UX design process, leading to unexpected end-user perceptions and responses. The challenge in shaping UX before user interface (UI) design is that there first must be prior knowledge of aesthetic affect. A study with 1,782 worldwide participants was conducted evaluating affective user-responses to 43 atomic aesthetics using 153,252 data points and presented as affect ratings (ARs). Results demonstrated high affective resonance amongst aesthetics evaluated, suggesting aesthetic AR may be a viable method of improving the UX design process by influencing user perceptions, responses and actions at a non-conscious level. This is the first of a series of studies in the direction of Aesthetic Semantics.},

The case study results indicate that preliminary UX/UI research before the development reduces the cost of product changes. Moreover, the paper proposes a set of metrics for testing the effectiveness of UX/UI design.},

However, not all of SMEs have a website that meets all of the principles of website design which are persuasive. Moreover, the color is rarely considered in making websites to raise the emotional bonding between the products and audiences of SMEs. Literature review, observation to four websites as case studies, and questionnaires distributed to respondents randomly were performed. This research aimed to evaluate the extent to which SMEs from Bandung exploited the use of color as an element in the web User Interface (UI) design and to analyze whether the color could provide emotional bonding, so the visitors were interested in purchase or trial of the product. This research finds that participants responses to color are various in different demographic factors. Zananachips.com is considered to successfully utilize the color in the web UI design to build its brand identity, raise interest in the trial of the product, and engage the consumer with the website. This research is expected to be a reference for SMEs in creating emotion, motivation, and persuasion through website design.},

  abstract = {User interface design plays an important role in web design. Designing a user interface that satisfies the emotional needs of the users is essential as the user interface plays a crucial role in generating remarkable user experiences for websites. A poorly designed user interface leads to bad user interaction while raising the users’ arousal and a displeasing user experience with a website elicits dissatisfaction emotion where consecutively results in avoidance and prevents revisit to the website. A standard emotional based user interface web design would enhance user experience which will lead to success of a website. Kansei engineering which is a popular technique in transforming users’ feelings into product design is used in this research. This study tries to convert the feelings and emotions of users into design elements with the use of Kansei engineering technology in order to design an appropriate higher learning institution website by identifying a standard web design that cultivates emotional engagement. A standard user interface web design guideline for the development of the higher learning institutions’ website has been proposed in this research. © 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.
